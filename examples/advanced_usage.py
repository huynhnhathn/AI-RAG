Python Programming Guide

Python is a versatile programming language that's great for beginners and experts alike.

Key Features:
- Easy to read and write syntax
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong community support
- Object-oriented and functional programming support

Common Use Cases:
- Web development with frameworks like Django and Flask
- Data science and machine learning with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Automation and scripting
- Desktop applications with tkinter or PyQt
- API development with FastAPI

Getting Started:
1. Install Python from python.org
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Start with basic syntax and data types
4. Practice with small projects

# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Guide

## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.

## Machine Learning Basics
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
   - Classification (predicting categories)
   - Regression (predicting continuous values)

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning patterns from unlabeled data
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality reduction

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with environment
   - Agent learns through rewards and penalties

### Popular ML Libraries:
- **Scikit-learn**: General-purpose ML library
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework by Google
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework by Facebook
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

### Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles

LangChain Framework Guide

LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Core Components:
1. LLMs and Chat Models - Interface with language models
2. Prompts - Templates for model inputs
3. Chains - Combine LLMs with other components
4. Agents - Use LLMs to decide actions
5. Memory - Persist state between calls
6. Document Loaders - Load data from various sources
7. Vector Stores - Store and retrieve embeddings

Key Features:
- Modular design for easy customization
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Built-in document processing capabilities
- Vector database integrations
- Memory management for conversations
- Tool integration for agents

Common Use Cases:
- Question-answering systems
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Document analysis and summarization
- Code generation and analysis
- Research assistants
- Content generation

Best Practices:
- Use appropriate chunk sizes for documents
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Use caching where appropriate
- Test with different prompt templates
